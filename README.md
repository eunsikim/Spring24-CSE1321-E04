## Assignments and Labs Submission
- Assignments and Labs are submitted through Gradescope
[Submission Guidelines](https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/fye/submissionguidelines.php)
- This is a C++ section. Your source code must be with the extension .cpp or .h
    - Ex:
	    - Lab1A.cpp
    Any other extension will result in an automatic 0
- Name your files correctly
    - Ex:
		Lab 1 has three parts A, B, and C. When you submit them, make sure they are named as instructed:
			- Lab1A.cpp 
			- Lab1B.cpp
			- Lab1C.cpp
- Submit only what it is required, any extra file that is not .java will result in a penalization towards the grading of the assignment or lab.
- Carefully read the whole instruction manual, it may contain important and specific information and requirements.
